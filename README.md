# CryptoClustering  
-All uploads made using terminal  
-Resources file includes our required csv file to run through the exercises  
-Crypto_Clustering.ipynb includes all requirements for the challenge. Though, was made entirely through the use of Google Colab so I'm not entirely sure how well it would work via Jupyter Notebook, but it should be good to go. If any problems arise, please let me know in my submission in Canvas. Thanks!
